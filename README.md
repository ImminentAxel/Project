# Project
FolderSync
Here is my application for C# Dev in QA.
This console program syncs 2 chosen folders and logs the events on both the console interface and the log.txt file

HOW TO USE
1.Complete the config.json file to specify the following:
  -source folder path;
  -replica folder path;
  -sync interval(in seconds);
  -log file path;(if log.txt cannot be found, it will create one in the specified directory)
  Example of a source path: "C:/Users/Documents/Source"
  Example of log path: "D:/Users/Documents/Logs" or "D:/Users/Documents/Logs/log.txt"
2.Run the FolderSync.exe file
3.Enjoy
